## Section 1: Route Inventory

### 1.1 Mounted Routers

The application mounts **27 routers** via `server/routers.ts`. Every router file that exists in the codebase is imported and mounted — no orphaned router files were found.

| # | Router Key | Source File | Procedure Count | Auth Level |
|---|-----------|-------------|:-:|---|
| 1 | `wazuh` | `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts` | ~20 | All protected |
| 2 | `graph` | `server/graph/graphRouter.ts` | ~15 | All protected |
| 3 | `pipeline` | `server/agenticPipeline/pipelineRouter.ts` | ~30 | All protected |
| 4 | `responseActions` | `server/agenticPipeline/responseActionsRouter.ts` | ~12 | All protected |
| 5 | `hybridrag` | `server/hybridrag/hybridragRouter.ts` | ~10 | Mixed (see §5.1) |
| 6 | `enhancedLLM` | `server/enhancedLLM/enhancedLLMRouter.ts` | ~8 | All protected |
| 7 | `llm` | `server/llm/llmRouter.ts` | ~6 | All protected |
| 8 | `indexer` | `server/indexer/indexerRouter.ts` | ~10 | All protected |
| 9 | `otx` | `server/otx/otxRouter.ts` | ~8 | All public (see §5.2) |
| 10 | `splunk` | `server/splunk/splunkRouter.ts` | ~6 | All protected |
| 11 | `notes` | `server/notes/notesRouter.ts` | ~5 | All protected |
| 12 | `savedSearches` | `server/savedSearches/savedSearchesRouter.ts` | ~5 | All protected |
| 13 | `baselines` | `server/baselines/baselinesRouter.ts` | ~5 | All protected |
| 14 | `baselineSchedules` | `server/baselines/baselineSchedulesRouter.ts` | ~10 | All protected |
| 15 | `driftAnalytics` | `server/baselines/driftAnalyticsRouter.ts` | ~8 | All protected |
| 16 | `alertQueue` | `server/alertQueue/alertQueueRouter.ts` | ~8 | All protected |
| 17 | `autoQueue` | `server/alertQueue/autoQueueRouter.ts` | ~8 | All protected |
| 18 | `sse` (Express) | `server/sse/alertStreamService.ts` | 2 (raw Express) | **Unauthenticated** (see §5.3) |
| 19 | `admin.users` | `server/admin/adminUsersRouter.ts` | ~5 | All admin |
| 20 | `admin.connectionSettings` | `server/admin/connectionSettingsRouter.ts` | ~5 | All admin |
| 21 | `localAuth` | `server/localAuth/localAuthRouter.ts` | ~5 | Mixed |
| 22 | `investigations` | Investigations router | ~8 | All protected |
| 23 | `feedback` | Feedback router | ~4 | All protected |
| 24 | `tokenUsage` | Token usage router | ~4 | All protected |
| 25 | `system` | `server/_core/systemRouter.ts` | ~3 | Protected |
| 26 | `auth` | `server/_core/` (built-in) | ~3 | Mixed |
| 27 | `status` (Express) | `server/_core/index.ts:73` | 1 (raw Express) | **Unauthenticated** |

### 1.2 Non-tRPC Endpoints

Two endpoints are mounted directly on Express, outside the tRPC middleware:

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `GET /api/status` | GET | None | Health check — probes DB, Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Indexer, LLM, OTX, Splunk |
| `GET /api/sse/alerts` | GET | None | Server-Sent Events stream for real-time alerts |
| `GET /api/sse/stats` | GET | None | SSE connection statistics |

### 1.3 Aggregate Counts

| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Total tRPC routers | 25 |
| Total Express endpoints | 3 |
| Total procedures (approx) | 277 |
| `publicProcedure` references | 29 |
| `protectedProcedure` references | 269 |
| `adminProcedure` references | 12 |

---

## Section 2: Orphan and Dead Surface Detection

### 2.1 Orphaned Frontend References

One dead tRPC reference was found:

| Frontend File | Call | Router Exists? | Impact |
|---------------|------|:-:|---|
| `client/src/components/AIChatBox.tsx` | `trpc.ai.chat` | No | Template component — not used in production pages |
| `client/src/pages/ComponentShowcase.tsx` | `trpc.ai.chat` | No | Dev showcase page — not user-facing |

**Verdict:** Low risk. `AIChatBox.tsx` is a template-provided component. No production page imports it. The `ai` router was never created because the app uses `hybridrag.chat` instead.

### 2.2 Orphaned Router Files

None found. Every `*Router.ts` file under `server/` has a corresponding import in `server/routers.ts`.

### 2.3 Pages Without tRPC Calls

| Page | Data Source | Explanation |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `NotFound.tsx` | None | Static 404 page — correct |
| `Status.tsx` | `fetch("/api/status")` | Uses raw Express endpoint, not tRPC — intentional for health dashboard |

---

## Section 3: Contract Truth

### 3.1 Input Validation Coverage

Every tRPC procedure that accepts user input uses Zod schema validation. The tRPC framework enforces this at the middleware level — if `.input()` is declared, Zod parses and rejects malformed requests before the handler executes.

Procedures without `.input()` are parameter-less queries (e.g., `status`, `list`, `getAll`) which is correct — they take no user input.

### 3.2 Critical Router Contract Audit

**wazuhRouter** — All procedures use Zod-validated inputs. The `wazuhGet()` function filters undefined params before forwarding to the Wazuh API. Response data passes through `stripSensitiveFields()` which removes `password`, `token`, `secret`, `api_key`, `key`, `auth`, `credential` fields recursively.

**pipelineRouter** — The `runFullPipeline` procedure validates:
```
z.object({
  rawAlert: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()),
  queueItemId: z.number().int().optional(),
})
```
This accepts arbitrary alert shapes (correct — Wazuh alerts vary by rule). The `queueItemId` is optional integer-validated.

**responseActionsRouter** — All mutations validate `actionId` as `z.string().min(1)`. The `execute` mutation validates `executionResult` as `z.string().max(5000).optional()` and `executionSuccess` as `z.boolean()`.

**connectionSettingsRouter** — Uses `z.record(z.string(), z.string())` for settings. Category is validated against a Zod enum (`wazuh_manager | wazuh_indexer | llm | otx | splunk`). All mutations require `adminProcedure`.

### 3.3 Contract Gaps Found

| Router | Issue | Severity | Detail |
|--------|-------|:--------:|--------|
| `enhancedLLMRouter` | No Zod on query procedures | Low | Query-only procedures with no user input — technically correct but inconsistent with other routers that use `.input(z.void())` |
| `otxRouter` | `indicatorLookup` accepts `z.string()` for IOC value | Low | No format validation on the IOC string — relies on OTX API to reject malformed values |

## Section 4: Runtime Behavior Truth

### 4.1 Success Paths

All Wazuh-facing procedures follow the same pattern:
1. Call `getEffectiveWazuhConfig()` — checks DB overrides, falls back to env vars
2. Call `wazuhGet(config, { path, params, rateLimitGroup })` — rate-limited, token-managed
3. Return `stripSensitiveFields(response.data)` — recursive field stripping

If Wazuh is not configured, procedures return `{ configured: false }` or similar empty-state objects. They do not throw — the UI renders "not configured" states.

### 4.2 Failure Paths

**Wazuh 401 handling:** `wazuhClient.ts` detects 401 responses, invalidates the cached JWT, re-authenticates once, and retries. If the retry also fails, the error propagates to the tRPC error boundary.

**Rate limiting:** Server-side rate limits per endpoint group (default: 60/min, alerts: 30/min, vulnerabilities: 20/min, syscheck: 20/min). Exceeding the limit throws a descriptive error with retry-after time.

**Database unavailability:** Most service functions check `if (!db) return []` or `return { nodes: [], edges: [] }`. This is fail-open for reads — the UI shows empty state rather than crashing. This is an acceptable pattern for a read-focused dashboard but should be noted.

### 4.3 Simulated or Hardcoded Behavior

| Component | What's Hardcoded | Why | Risk |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|:----:|
| `enhancedLLMService.getDGXHealth()` | `totalMB: 131072`, `modelWeightsMB: 30720`, `quantization: "Q8_K_XL"`, `contextSize: 32768` | Default values for DGX Spark hardware profile | Low — overwritten by live `/health` and `/metrics` responses when DGX is reachable |
| `enhancedLLMService.getQueueStats()` | `priorityCounts: { critical: 0, high: 0, normal: 0 }` | Per-priority breakdown not implemented in PriorityQueue class | Medium — the queue tracks `depth` and `active` accurately, but per-priority counts are always zero. **This is misleading if displayed in the UI.** |
| `kgTrustHistory` table | Schema defined, never written to | Planned feature, explicitly marked DORMANT in code | Low — 3 DORMANT comments in code, documented in evidence package |

### 4.4 Background Polling

Two background polling systems start automatically:

| System | Interval | Trigger | Wazuh Impact |
|--------|----------|---------|:------------:|
| Auto-Queue Polling | 60s | Auto-starts if any enabled rules exist in DB | Queries Wazuh Indexer for matching alerts — bounded by `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH = 10` |
| Baseline Scheduler | 5 min | Auto-starts on server boot | Queries Wazuh for baseline snapshots per schedule — rate-limited by `wazuhGet()` |

Both systems are operator-controlled (rules/schedules must be explicitly created) but start automatically once configured. The SSE alert stream starts polling only when a client connects and stops when the last client disconnects.

## Section 5: Security and Safety Truth

### 5.1 Authentication Gaps

| Endpoint | Auth Level | Risk | Recommendation |
|----------|:----------:|:----:|----------------|
| `GET /api/status` | None | Low | Health check — returns connectivity status, no sensitive data. Acceptable for monitoring. |
| `GET /api/sse/alerts` | None | **Medium** | Streams real-time Wazuh alerts to any connected client. Should require session cookie validation. |
| `GET /api/sse/stats` | None | Low | Returns connection count only. |
| `otxRouter.*` (all 8 procedures) | Public | **Medium** | OTX threat intel queries are unauthenticated. An unauthenticated user could enumerate IOC lookups. Should be `protectedProcedure`. |
| `hybridrag.modelStatus` | Public | Low | Returns LLM availability — no sensitive data. |
| `hybridrag.sessionHistory` | Public | **Medium** | Returns chat session history without auth check. Could leak analyst queries. |
| `hybridrag.notes.list` | Public | **Medium** | Returns analyst notes without auth check. Could leak investigation notes. |
| `hybridrag.notes.getById` | Public | **Medium** | Returns individual analyst note without auth check. |

### 5.2 SSRF Surface

The `connectionSettingsRouter.testConnection` endpoint (admin-only) accepts user-provided `host` values and makes HTTP requests to them. There is **no host allowlist or blocklist**. An admin could set `host` to `169.254.169.254` (AWS metadata) or `127.0.0.1` to probe internal services.

**Mitigating factors:**
- Requires `adminProcedure` (only admin users can access)
- The connection test only attempts HTTPS connections to specific ports (55000, 9200)
- No response body is returned to the caller — only success/failure status

**Risk level:** Low (admin-only) but worth noting for defense-in-depth.

### 5.3 Token and Secret Handling

| Aspect | Implementation | Status |
|--------|---------------|:------:|
| Wazuh JWT | Server-side only, cached in memory, never logged, never sent to frontend | Correct |
| Wazuh credentials | Read from env or DB (AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest) | Correct |
| `stripSensitiveFields()` | Recursively removes `password`, `token`, `secret`, `api_key`, `key`, `auth`, `credential` from all Wazuh API responses | Correct |
| Session cookies | `httpOnly: true`, `sameSite: "none"` (HTTPS) or `"lax"` (HTTP), `secure` flag matches protocol | Correct |
| Password hashing | bcrypt with salt rounds (localAuth) | Correct |
| Encryption key derivation | SHA-256 of `JWT_SECRET` → AES-256-GCM key | Acceptable — single key source is a tradeoff |

### 5.4 Read-Only Enforcement

The Wazuh client (`wazuhClient.ts`) exposes only `wazuhGet()`. The only POST to Wazuh is `/security/user/authenticate` for token acquisition. No PUT, DELETE, or PATCH methods exist in the Wazuh client.

The `responseActions.execute` mutation is a **DB state transition only** — it calls `transitionActionState()` which updates the `response_actions` table. It does not execute any action against Wazuh or any external system. The name "execute" refers to marking the action as executed in the workflow, not performing the action.

### 5.5 tRPC Error Handling

The tRPC middleware is mounted without a custom `onError` handler. In development mode, tRPC returns full error details including stack traces. In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), tRPC's default behavior strips internal error details from `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` responses but preserves messages from explicitly thrown `TRPCError` instances.

**Note:** Some routers throw raw `Error` instead of `TRPCError` (e.g., `baselinesRouter.ts:43` throws `new Error("Database unavailable")`). tRPC wraps these as `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` but the message string is still returned to the client. These messages are generic enough to not be a security risk, but the pattern is inconsistent.

## Section 6: Evidence Document Truth

### 6.1 SOC_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE.md

| Claim | Accurate? | Issue |
|-------|:---------:|-------|
| "1098 tests passing across 46 test files" | **Stale** | Current count is 1153 tests across 48 files |
| Compliance matrix (10 rows, all ✅) | Accurate | Each claim has a verifiable file reference |
| `kgTrustHistory` truth note | Accurate | Correctly states "not yet populated at runtime" |
| Pipeline chain description | Accurate | All 4 stages + documentation stage exist and are wired |

### 6.2 TRUTH_REMEDIATION_EVIDENCE.md

| Claim | Accurate? | Issue |
|-------|:---------:|-------|
| "What We Did Not Prove" section | Accurate | Honestly lists 4 unproven areas |
| Provenance persistence proof | Accurate | `provenance.test.ts` performs real DB write/read |
| Stage output proof | Accurate | `stageOutput.test.ts` calls real agent functions with mocked LLM |
| Test transcript files | Accurate | 4 files in `test-output/` directory |

### 6.3 Stale Numbers

The SOC_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE.md test count (1098/46) is stale. The current count is 1153/48. This should be updated.

---

## Section 7: Endpoint Classification

Every procedure is classified into one of four categories:

| Classification | Definition | Count |
|---------------|------------|------:|
| **LIVE** | Calls a real external service or performs real DB operations | ~220 |
| **LIVE-CONDITIONAL** | Works when the backing service is configured; returns empty state otherwise | ~30 |
| **SCAFFOLDED** | Code exists and compiles but the backing feature is not runtime-active | ~5 |
| **STATIC** | Returns hardcoded or computed-from-config values | ~5 |

### Notable SCAFFOLDED endpoints:

| Endpoint | Router | Why Scaffolded |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `kgTrustHistory` queries | `graphRouter` | Table exists, queries work, but no writer populates data — always returns empty |
| `enhancedLLM.queueStats.priorityCounts` | `enhancedLLMRouter` | Queue depth and active counts are real; per-priority breakdown is hardcoded to 0 |

### Notable STATIC endpoints:

| Endpoint | Router | What's Static |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `enhancedLLM.dgxHealth` (defaults) | `enhancedLLMRouter` | Hardware profile defaults (128GB, Q8_K_XL) — overwritten when DGX is reachable |
| `enhancedLLM.sessionTypes` | `enhancedLLMRouter` | Returns config constants — intentionally static |

---

## Section 8: Findings Summary

### What is solid

The core API surface is well-structured. Wazuh integration follows a clean proxy pattern with server-side token management, rate limiting, response field stripping, and read-only enforcement. The agentic pipeline (triage → correlation → hypothesis → response actions) is fully wired with DB persistence and audit trails. Input validation via Zod is comprehensive across all user-facing mutations. Password handling uses bcrypt. Connection credentials use AES-256-GCM encryption at rest.

### What needs attention before production

| Priority | Finding | Section |
|:--------:|---------|:-------:|
| **High** | SSE alert stream (`/api/sse/alerts`) has no authentication | §5.1 |
| **Medium** | OTX router uses `publicProcedure` for all 8 endpoints | §5.1 |
| **Medium** | `hybridrag.sessionHistory` and `hybridrag.notes.list/getById` are public | §5.1 |
| **Medium** | `enhancedLLM.queueStats.priorityCounts` always returns zeros — misleading | §4.3 |
| **Low** | SOC_COMPLIANCE_EVIDENCE.md test count is stale (1098 vs 1153) | §6.3 |
| **Low** | No host allowlist on `connectionSettings.testConnection` SSRF surface | §5.2 |
| **Low** | Some routers throw raw `Error` instead of `TRPCError` | §5.5 |
| **Low** | `AIChatBox.tsx` references non-existent `trpc.ai.chat` router | §2.1 |

### What is honestly not proven

This audit is a static code analysis. It does not prove:
- That every endpoint returns correct data when connected to a live Wazuh instance
- That rate limits behave correctly under concurrent load
- That the LLM fallback chain (custom → builtin) works reliably in production
- That the baseline scheduler handles timezone edge cases correctly

These would require integration testing against a live environment, which is outside the scope of a code audit.
