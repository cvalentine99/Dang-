Knowledge Graph Page (/graph) - Current State Analysis
=======================================================

WHAT'S ALREADY BUILT:
1. D3 force-directed graph visualization (4-layer KG)
2. Node types: resource, endpoint, parameter, response, auth_method, use_case, index, field, error_pattern
3. Node detail panel (click to inspect properties + raw JSON)
4. Layer filter dropdown (API Ontology, Operational Semantics, Schema Lineage, Error & Failure)
5. Risk level filter (SAFE, MUTATING, DESTRUCTIVE)
6. Search across all KG layers (keyword search with dropdown results)
7. Risk Paths panel (attack path detection with animated path highlighting)
8. Graph Legend with type toggles (show/hide node types)
9. Stats overlay (endpoint/resource/use-case/index counts, risk breakdown, HTTP method breakdown)
10. Zoom controls (zoom in, zoom out, reset)
11. Node dragging (D3 drag behavior)
12. Risk glow effects on highlighted paths
13. Method badges on endpoint nodes (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE color-coded)
14. LLM lock icons on blocked endpoints

BACKEND CAPABILITIES (graphRouter):
- etlFullSync / etlSyncLayer / etlStatus (KG extraction pipeline)
- graphStats (entity counts, risk/method breakdown)
- overviewGraph (4-layer graph with filtering)
- endpointsByResource (drill into a resource)
- endpointDetail (full endpoint with params/responses)
- searchGraph (cross-layer keyword search)
- resourceOverview (all resources with endpoint counts)
- useCases (all operational semantics)
- errorPatterns (all error patterns)
- endpoints (paginated, filtered endpoint list)
- riskAnalysis (dangerous endpoints, resource risk map, LLM blocked count)
- detectRiskPaths (attack path detection)
- riskPathGraph (D3-formatted risk path data)
- answerProvenance (trust auditing)
- analystQuery (agentic LLM pipeline)
- Investigation CRUD (create, list, get, update, add/delete notes)
- Investigation export (Markdown, HTML)

WHAT'S MISSING / COULD BE ENHANCED:
1. NO endpoint detail drill-down from graph - clicking a node shows properties but can't expand to see params/responses
2. NO resource-level drill-down - can't click a resource to see all its endpoints
3. NO neighbor expansion - can't right-click a node to "expand neighbors"
4. NO minimap for large graphs
5. NO edge relationship tooltips
6. NO graph layout options (force, hierarchical, radial)
7. NO "focus on node" (center + zoom to a specific node from search)
8. NO endpoint table view (tabular alternative to graph)
9. NO comparison view (compare two resources or endpoints side-by-side)
10. NO graph export (PNG/SVG)
11. Stats overlay and detail panel overlap when both visible
12. Search results don't highlight/focus the node in the graph
13. No connection to Investigations page (can't add graph findings to an investigation)
14. No use-case or error-pattern detail views
15. Risk path panel doesn't link to the actual endpoint details
